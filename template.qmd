## Example slide

### This is a subtitle

Here we have some text that may run over several lines of the slide frame,
depending on how long it is.

- first item 
    - A sub item

Next, we'll brief review some theme-specific components.

- Note that _all_ of the standard Reveal.js
[features](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
can be used with this theme, even if we don't highlight them here.

## Additional theme classes

### Some extra things you can do with the clean theme

Special classes for emphasis

- `.alert` class for default emphasis, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
- `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.

Cross-references

- `.button` class provides a Beamer-like button, e.g.
[[Summary]{.button}](#sec-summary)

We've deliberarely kept this template lean, to get you up and running as fast as
possible.

We provide a separate
[demo template](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo),
with more examples for integrating code, tables, figures, etc.
